${bold}SOFTMAN${normal}

SoftMan (Software Manager) is mostly a wrapper around frequently used apt-get command sequences, plus a few repair tools. Beside the repair tools, the main difference between softman and apt-get is that softman always grabs build dependencies before it installs requested packages.

${bold}USAGE${normal}

	Use ${bold}sudo softman OPTION${normal} to manage software without first updating the package list.
	Use as ${bold}sudo softman -u OPTION${normal} to manage software with package list update first.

${bold}FLAGS${normal}

	${bold}-u${normal} is equivalent to sudo apt-get update

${bold}OPTIONS${normal}

	${bold}upgrade${normal}: update/upgrade the system software with suggested build dependent packages.
	
${bold}REPOSITORY TOOLS${normal}

	${bold}list${normal}: List all installed repositories.
	${bold}add${normal}: Add a PPA repository. Separate with a space multiple repositories listed together.
	${bold}remove${normal}: Remove a PPA repository. Separate with a space multiple repositories listed together.
	${bold}purge${normal}: Purge a repository. Typically PPA repository. This removes software installed from the repository, installs the distro version when available.
	
${bold}SOFTWARE TOOLS${normal}
	
	${bold}find${normal}: locate a package or list of packages available for installation. Wildcards allowed.
	${bold}install${normal}: install software with suggested build dependent packages. Wildcards allowed.
	${bold}reinstall${normal}: reinstall software with suggested build dependent packages. Wildcards allowed.
	${bold}build${normal}: download package source files and compile into a .deb binary file ready for installation
	${bold}flush${normal}: clear the download cache and automatically remove packages that are no longer required.
	
${bold}SYSTEM REPAIR TOOLS${normal}

	${bold}fix${normal}: fix broken packages and configure partially installed software.
	${bold}findbad${normal}: find packages with corrupt files / find packages with missing files.
	${bold}fixbad${normal}: find curupt software and automatically reinstall their packages. Use with caution.
	${bold}fixmissing${normal}: find software with missing files and automatically reinstall their packages. Use with caution.
	${bold}rebuildsystem${normal}: reinstall all installed software. Use with extreme caution.

${bold}EXAMPLES${normal}

	${bold}softman -u${normal} will only download the list of available packages.
	${bold}softman -u install gimp${normal} will download the up-to-date list of packages available to the system then install gimp
	${bold}softman -u install gimp kate amarok${normal} will download the up-to-date list of packages available to the system then reinstall gimp, kate and amorok.
	
	${bold}Within a script, do:${normal}
	
	${bold}source \$path/softman -u'${normal}
	${bold}source \$path/softman -u reinstall krita'${normal}

${bold}VERSION${normal}
	
	$version
